  <h2 class= "impactfont" id="hardware"> 1. Computer Anatomy </h2>
  
  <p> In order for a computer to properly function, there are essential items needed to make it work and carry out the tasks. These are the main elements that a computer uses to function. </p>

<h3 class="cursivefont"> The Motherboard </h3>
<img width= 300px;

 <p> The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. The motherboard is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity point, through which all components and external peripherals connect.  </p>

<br> 
  
<h3 class="cursivefont"> The CPU </h3>
<img width= 300px;

<p>The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an application, the instructions are getting sent to the CPU. It sends CPU commands to direct the actions of all the components in the computer.</p>

<br>

 <h3 class="cursivefont"> RAM (random access memory) </h3> 
<img width= 300px; src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg/220px-Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg">

<p> Random Access Memory (RAM), is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data that the computer uses. RAM allows the computer to access data quickly and efficiently, which can speed up the overall performance of the system. The RAM is used for short-term memory.</p>

<br>
  
<h3 class="cursivefont"> Hard Drive </h3> 
<img width= 300px; src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg/220px-Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg">

<p> A hard drive is a storage device used to store data that is digital such as documents, photos, videos, music, and files.</p>

<br>
  
<h3 class="cursivefont"> Power Supply Unit </h3> 
<img width= 300px; src="https://img.hexus.net/v2/TekSpek/PSUs/psu1.jpg">

<p> The power supply unit (PSU) is the component that provides electrical power from the outlet to all the  components of the computer. It converts the AC (alternating current) power from the wall outlet to the DC (direct current) power that helps the computer to operate.</p>

<h2 class= "impactfont" id="peripheraldevices"> 2. Peripheral Devices </h2>

<p>Peripheral devices are external components that are connected to a computer system to provide additional functions. <strong> These devices are not a part of the computer, however they work with the computer or are integrated into the system.</strong> Input Devices and Output Devices are  both examples of peripheral devices. </p>

<h3 class="cursivefont"> Input Devices </h3> 
<p> Input devices are peripheral devices that help to provide input to the computer system. Examples of input devices include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Keyboard</li>
    <li> Mouse</li>
    <li> Touchpad</li>
    <li> Scanner</li>
    <li> Joystick</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="cursivefont"> Output Devices </h3> 
  <p> Output devices are peripheral devices that help to provide output to the computer system. Examples of output devices include the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Headphones</li>
    <li> Monitor</li>
    <li> Printer</li>
    <li> Speaker</li>
    <li> Projector</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class= "impactfont" id="software"> 3. Software and Operating Systems</h2>

<p> Software is a set of instructions, programs, and procedures that allow a computer to perform various tasks and applications. There are two types of main softwares: System software and Application software
</p>

<br>

<h3 class= "monospacefont"> System Software </h3>
<p> System software helps with controlling the hardware for the computer and providing a platform for running software applications. An example of a system software is macOS. </p>

<br>

<h3 class= "monospacefont"> Application Software </h3>
<p>Application Software helps to perform tasks and applications and allows us to apply ourselves to a specific task. An example of a application software is editing a photo in Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<br>
  
<h3 class= "monospacefont"> Programming Software </h3>
<p> There is another software called Programming Software which essentially helps with developing new softwares using software. It helps with creating and debugging programs.</p>

<h2 class= "impactfont" id="malware"> 4. Malware </h2>

<img width= 400px src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200xn/p0d2q3sr.png">


<p> Malware is short for malicious software, which is a software that is designed to damage computer systems, networks, and devices. Malware can take many different forms. Some of the forms that malware can exist in is: </p>

  <ol>
    <li> Viruses- Malware designed to replicate itself and spread.They also corrupt website files and prevent access into your computer.</li> <br>
    <li> Worms- Malware that replicates and places itself on systems connected by networks and internet.</li><br>
    <li> Trojan Horse- Malware designed to look like a normal program but contains malicious code.</li><br>
    <li> Spyware- Malware used to track your browsing history and a activity. It collects your information and sensitive data without the user knowing.</li><br>
    <li> Ransomware- Malware used to shut down and deny access to your computer unless you pay the attacker to get your computer back.</li>
  </ol>

<h3 class="cursivefont"> How to prevent Malware </h3>

  <p> To prevent malware in your devices you can use an anti-virus system. This helps with preventing attackers from getting access to your computer and hacking it. Some other wats to prevent malware is uninstall suspicious programs, remove unknown extensions and do not go on any untrusted websites.</p>

<h3 class="cursivefont"> Fragmentation </h3>

<p>Fragmentation occurs when files on a computer become scattered in different parts of the disk. Files are broken up into pieces and stored in different parts of the hard drive. This can cause the computer to become slow and hard to use. It can lead to the computer crashing and errors. </p>

<p> To fix this, we can use a defragmentation tool which helps to rearrange the scattered pieces. This helps to make the computer work better so there are no errors. </p>
