  <h2 class= "impactfont" id="whatisc"> 1. What is C#? </h2>
  
  <p class= "monospacefont"> C# is a programming language that was developed by Microsoft. It is used throughout a wide range of applications and websites. C# can be used to create multiple programs. Some things you can create with c# are games, math equations, patterns and trivia!</p>

<h2 class= "impactfont" id="datatypes"> 2. Data Types and Variables </h2>

<h3 class= "cursivefont"> Variables and Constants </h3>

<p> A Varible in computer programming is a data value that can be changed throughout a program. A Constant is a data value that cannot be changed once defined. Constants and variables can be different data types, such as integer, double, or string. But once a  constant is defined with a data type, you cannot change it. Variables can be assigned different data types throughout the program.</p>

<p> For example, if you want to find the area of a circle, you have to input "pi". For a constant you must put "const double pi=3.14;" so that pi will remain the same throughout the program. For a variable, it can change throughout the program.</p>

<h3 class= "cursivefont"> Input and Output </h3>

<p> Console.WriteLine() method is used to display output on the console window and next line </p>

</p> Console.ReadLine() method is used to read input from the user.</p>

<p> Console.Write() method is used to display output on the console window without moving the cursor to the next line. </p>
  
<h3 class= "cursivefont"> Arithemitic Operators </h3>

<p> Arithmetic operators are used to perform operations such as addition and subtraction. </p>

<ul>
    <li> Addition Operator(+)- Operator adds 2 operands.</li>
    <li> Subtraction Operator(-)- Operator subtracts one operand from the other. </li>
    <li> Multiplication Operator(*)- Operator multiples one operand from another.</li>
    <li> Devision Operator(/)- Operator divides numerator by the denominator.</li>
    <li> Modulo Operator(%)- Operator provides the remainder from a divison equation.</li>
   <li> Increment Operator(++)- Operator increses integer value by 1. </li>
   <li> Decrement Operator(--)- Operator decreases value by 1</li>
  </ul>

<h3 class= "cursivefont"> Logical Operators </h3>

<p>The logical operators are used to perform specific logical operations in c#. There are three logical operators: AND, OR & NOT</p>

  <ol>
    <li> AND Operator(&&)- If both the operands are non zero then the condition becomes true. Ex. (A && B) is false. </li>
    <li> OR Operator(||)- If any of the two operands are non zero then the condition become true. Ex. (A || B) is true. </li>
    <li> NOT Operator(!)- If the condition is true then the NOT Operator will make it false. Reverses the logical state of the operand.</li>
  </ol>

<h3 class= "cursivefont"> Loops </h3>

<p> C# has several types of loops, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. "For", "while", and "do-while" are loops used for coding in C#. 

<p> For loops- The for loop executes one or more statements multiple times as long as the loop condition is satisfied..</p>

 <img width= 400px src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d959b66d39a47dd74e14617c5403edd2-lq">

<p> While loops-The while loop continuously executes one or more statements as long as the loop condition is satisfied. If the loop condition is true, the body of the for loop is executed..</p>

<p> Do while- The do while loop executes one or more statements repeatedly as long as the loop condition remains true. This loop is similar to the while loop, but with a key difference: the while loop checks the condition at the beginning of the loop, while the do while loop checks it at the end. .</p>

<h2 class= "impactfont" id="programs"> 3. Programs </h2>

<p> Throughout the unit of C#, we learned many programs and how to create them in various ways. Below is a link that will open github and show all the information and the programs that we learned.</p>
